## Content Analysis

### Resume Parsing

When a user uploads an existing resume, our AI:

1. **Structure Recognition**: Identifies sections (experience, education, skills)
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies companies, roles, dates, and technologies
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates tone and impact of achievement statements
4. **Grammar & Style Check**: Identifies potential language improvements

### Job Description Analysis

For targeted resume creation:

1. **Requirement Extraction**: Identifies must-have and nice-to-have requirements
2. **Keyword Identification**: Extracts industry-specific and role-specific terms
3. **Cultural Indicators**: Identifies company values and culture markers
4. **Priority Assessment**: Ranks requirements by importance and frequency

## Content Generation

### Achievement Enhancement

AI improves the impact of achievement statements:

```
Original: "Managed a team that built a new customer portal"

AI Enhanced: "Led cross-functional team of 8 developers to deliver customer 
portal that increased user engagement by 27% and reduced support tickets by 35%"
```

Key enhancements include:

1. **Quantification**: Adding metrics and numbers
2. **Action Verbs**: Using stronger, more specific verbs
3. **Outcome Focus**: Emphasizing results, not just activities
4. **Specificity**: Adding concrete details and context

### Skill Gap Analysis

The AI identifies potential skills gaps between your experience and job requirements:

1. **Gap Detection**: Comparing your skills against job requirements
2. **Suggestion Generation**: Recommending ways to address or reframe gaps
3. **Alternative Phrasing**: Finding equivalent skills you may have
4. **Prioritization**: Focusing on the most critical missing elements

## Personalization Engine

### Tailoring Algorithm

The AI tailors your resume to specific positions through:

1. **Priority Reordering**: Presenting most relevant experience first
2. **Emphasis Adjustment**: Highlighting skills matching the job description
3. **Terminology Alignment**: Using industry-specific language from the posting
4. **Experience Framing**: Contextualizing past roles for the target position

### Learning System

The AI improves over time through:

1. **Feedback Loop**: Learning from user acceptance/rejection of suggestions
2. **Success Tracking**: Analyzing which resumes lead to interviews
3. **Industry Trends**: Staying current with changing terminology and skills
4. **A/B Testing**: Comparing different approaches for similar positions

## Technical Implementation

### AI Models
