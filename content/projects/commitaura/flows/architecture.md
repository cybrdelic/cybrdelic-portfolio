# Technical Architecture

This document outlines Commitaura's technical architecture, providing insights into its design principles, component structure, and implementation details.

## System Overview

Commitaura implements an event-driven architecture optimized for performance and reliability. The system comprises several key components working in harmony to deliver intelligent commit message generation.

### Core Architecture

The system is built on four primary layers:

1. Interface Layer
   - Git hook integration
   - Command-line interface
   - Configuration management
   - User interaction handling

2. Processing Layer
   - Diff analysis engine
   - Context extraction
   - Message generation
   - Template processing

3. API Integration Layer
   - Request handling
   - Response processing
   - Rate limiting
   - Error management

4. Storage Layer
   - Cache management
   - Configuration storage
   - Template persistence
   - History tracking
